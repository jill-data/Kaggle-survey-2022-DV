Kaggle survey 2022

FINAL COURSE PROJECT
====================
In this assignment, you will identify a dataset of interest and perform an exploratory analysis to better understand the shape & structure of the data, investigate initial questions, and develop preliminary insights & hypotheses. Your final submission will form a report comprising captioned visualizations that convey key insights gained during your analysis.
Step 1: Data Selection
First, you will pick a topic area of interest to you and find a dataset that can provide insights into that topic.
However, if you want to investigate a different topic and dataset, you are free to do so. If you decide to work with a self-selected dataset, please check with the course staff to ensure it's appropriate for this assignment. Data collection and preparation (also known as data wrangling) can be very tedious and time-consuming.
After selecting a topic and dataset — but before analysis — you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you’d like to investigate.
Part 2: Exploratory Visual Analysis
Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.
In the first phase, you should be able to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform “sanity checks” for patterns you expect to see!
In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions and any new ones during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a helpful answer. Then refine the visualization (e.g., by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, transforming your data by filtering or subsetting it, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each question, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants it.
Final Deliverable
By December 7, students must submit a set of five captioned visualizations detailing the most critical `insights' emerging from the exploratory data analysis. Each visualization must be complemented with a 200-word text box describing the `insights,' which can include essential surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) and responses to your analysis questions.
